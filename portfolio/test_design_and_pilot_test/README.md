## Test Design And Pilot Test
#### Requirements & Deliverables
The requirement of the test is that the preliminary usability test plan should be based on outline consist of 

    the scope and purpose of the tests
    the performance objectives to be tested
    what kind and how may participants
    what scenarios to test
    specific tests and documentation
    equipment and physical conditions
    staff roles during test
    test data collected and data protections
    qualitative and quantitative test metrics
    how the test metrics will be analyzed

A brief pilot usability test is runned to test the paper prototype and a short refletion report is required.

In our test plan, we delivered the test plan organized according to every items from the test outline and considered specific cases for test. We also attached a sample survey and a sample consent form.


#### Grades and Improvement

Grade is 100/100. The test we did covers all the outline. To improve, more questions could be added to the survey to collect feedback.
