#### High-Fidelity Functional Prototype
In this task, we finished the final version of our user interface, and we also test it with some subjects. We revised some ideas and concepts of the interface designing. We completed all the documents related to this interface test.
#### Requirements
- Complete a high-fidelity functional prototype of your design.
- Review the results of testing your paper prototype and incorporate any changes based on your review of your paper mockup tests.
- Make sure users can experience a closer representation of the actual product and provide feedback as they experience the prototype in use.
- The prototype should provide a realistic experience of your interface in actual use.
#### Deliverables
- A video showing a member of your team using this functional prototype to enact three to five scenarios.
- The YouTube video links.
- The Adobe XD files that would enable the instructor to try out your functional prototype.
- A paper summarizing the experience running this study, including what went well and what you feel could use improvements for the next version of this study.
