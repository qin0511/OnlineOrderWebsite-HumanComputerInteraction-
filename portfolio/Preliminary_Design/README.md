## Preliminary Design
#### Requirements & Deliverables
- The purpose of this step is to have an initial design for our project.
- There are several key components for this step: elevator pitch, user/task analysis, conceptual model, and functionality and usage scenarios.
- In our pdf file, we've made a table of content that can help reader read through our documentation easily.
#### Grades and Improvement
- The final grade is 99/100 for this step. We've made some mistakes in the project pdf. We were inconsistent with our langauge. Our project is on food pick-up website, but we used the word "delivery man". We did not specify carefully on what user will do for each task. However, these mistakes were quickly fixed in the next phase.
